What support is included with an Azure Support plan?	We have designed our Azure Support plans to meet different business needs. Paid support plans provide access to Technical Support for break-fix issues on a 24x7 basis. Higher tiers of support plans offer faster initial response times and access to Advisory support, Configuration Optimization Reviews, and other benefits. More information about the existing support plans can be found at the [Azure Support Plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/plans/) page.	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	8

"Break-fix" is an industry term that refers to “work involved in supporting a technology when it fails in the normal course of its function, which requires intervention by a support organization to be restored to working order."	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	9
How does Professional Direct Limited Advisory Support compare to Premier Advisory support?	Professional Direct (ProDirect) Advisory support provides you access to Azure Support guidance based on (1) publically available, best practices documentation regarding Microsoft Azure and (2) information from the Azure Forums. ProDirect advisors offer you support based on their access to Microsoft documentation, to the Microsoft Azure Support Engineers, and also to the Microsoft Azure product group. Best practices guidance may include, for example,\n\n*   Planning for deployments and migrations\n\n*   Planning for hybrid cloud solutions\n\n*   Boosting performance\n\n*   Improving reliability and recoverability\n\n*   Enhancing security\n\nProDirect, however, is more limited than Premier Advisory Support. ProDirect advisors do not provide detailed advisory assistance specific to an individual customer such as design, architecture, or code reviews; detailed instructions for application or configuration tuning (e.g., performance tuning); or the verification of specifications. ProDirect does not provide onsite support or engage in implementation activities such as, but not limited to, coding or configuration for customer development or deployment on Microsoft Azure.	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	10
What is a Preview (beta) service or feature?	Microsoft may provide access to Azure preview, beta, or other pre-release features, services, software, or regions, to obtain feedback and for evaluation purposes. Previews that are available are identified by a “Preview” tag in the Azure Portal. They are also listed on the [Preview page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/preview/) or in the [Preview section of the Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/preview/).\n\nThere are many different kinds of Preview Services and Features for Microsoft Azure, with service availability and program access being the biggest differentiators:\n\n*   Public Preview: made available to Microsoft Azure subscribers through the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), these services are intended to be used as an early-look into what is coming and as a chance to test upcoming services and features.\n\n*   Private Preview: provided only to small subset of customers, in direct contact with the Azure Engineering teams, focused on direct and constant feedback during the development phase of a service\n\n*   Limited Preview: a fixed and limited number of customers can have access to this Preview program, and once a maximum threshold is met, no more users are allowed into the program.\n\nWhen Microsoft offers you early access to Azure preview services and features, they are subject to reduced or different service terms as set forth in your service agreement and the preview supplemental terms. Preview Services and Features are provided “as-is”, “with all faults”, and “as available”, and are excluded from the Service SLAs or any Limited Warranties provided by Microsoft for Azure Services released to general availability (GA), and are made available to you on the condition that you agree to these terms of use, which supplement your agreement governing use of Microsoft Azure.	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	11
Do Azure Support Plans cover Preview (beta) services or features?	Support for Preview services and features is provided only for “Public Preview” programs (see FAQ above). Other non-Public Preview and/or Beta services may be supported through our forums or other channels. Azure Support plans do not cover non-Public Previews services.\n\nGenerally, Azure paid support plans provide technical support for services and features in Public Preview. Some exceptions to the Public Preview support coverage applies, and services/features not covered on your support plan can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/preview/). Private or Limited previews are not included in the scope of the Azure Support plans and may or may not be supported through the [Azure Forums](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/community/).\n\nTechnical support for a Public Preview service or feature is limited to break-fix scenarios and is available only in English with 24x7 support available for severities A and B (according to your support plan).	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	12
What are Azure Support Benefits and how do I get them?	Access to Azure technical support requires a [paid support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/plans/). However, some Microsoft programs could give you access to Azure technical support via Support Benefits even if you don’t have a paid support plan. The following programs include Azure Support Benefits:\n\n*   [MSDN and BizSpark](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/)\n\n*   [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/core-benefits)\n\n*   [Signature Cloud Support](https://partner.microsoft.com/Support/signature-cloud-support)\n\nEach of these programs will give you different support benefits, from response times to the number of requests that can be submitted. Please check the details of each program from the links above for more information.\n\nThere are also some programs like MSDN and BizSpark Plus that give you other Microsoft Azure Benefits on top of access to Technical Support, such as monthly usage credits, free services and discounted consumption rates.

Why is submitting a request online the preferred method of contacting Azure Support?	Submitting support requests online allows us to deliver fast and deep technical expertise in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Due to the detailed nature of the requests, it is much easier to provide relevant information online, compared to reading this information over the phone. This model also eliminates unproductive hold time for a simple, intuitive online process. As a result, customer problems are routed more quickly, to the most qualified engineer.	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	15
Is there a phone number I can call to contact the Azure Support?

I am developing applications on-behalf of, or assisting my client that is running on Microsoft Azure. How do I get support?	You can get support from Azure in two ways:\n\n*   Being the Account Administrator of your customer’s subscription, you can purchase an Azure Support plan for that account, as with any subscription you own under the same account are covered by the same support plan. You can also use your Partner benefits (for example, Signature Cloud Support or MPN Support) to submit a support request, without having to acquire a dedicated Azure Support plan.\n\n*   Get support using your customer’s account. To do so, the Partner (you) must have administrator or owner privileges to the customer’s subscription. The customer’s subscription then needs to have a support plan covering it, or the Partner can use their Azure Support Benefits (for example, Signature Cloud Support or MPN Support) to submit a support request, without having to acquire a dedicated Azure Support plan.	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	23
What is Initial Response Time and how quickly can I expect to hear back from someone after submitting my support request?	Initial Response Time is the period from when you submit your support request to when a Microsoft Support Engineer contacts you and starts working on your support request. The Initial Response Time varies with both the support plan and the Business Impact of the request (also known as Severity).	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	24
How quickly will you resolve my support request?	Microsoft is committed to assist you in resolving your issue as soon as possible. Sometimes that means focusing efforts on reducing the business impact and mitigating any negative impact to your operation, before moving to a full solution. Therefore, we make a commitment to Initial Response Time and also in working with you until the impact of your issue is mitigated, having no direct SLA for support request resolution. The time it takes to troubleshoot and resolve a support request varies greatly based on the specifics of the issue. We will work with you to get the issue resolved as fast as possible.	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	25
I’m running a non-Microsoft technology on Microsoft Azure or a custom application built using Open Source Software (OSS). Does my plan support it?	Microsoft offers customers the ability to run non-Microsoft technologies on the Microsoft Azure platform, including but not limited to Linux, Oracle, SAP, and IBM. For all scenarios that are eligible for support through an Azure Support plan, Microsoft Support will help in isolating the issue between the Microsoft Azure Service and your custom application.\n\nFull technical support will be provided if the issue is determined to be caused by a Microsoft Azure service or platform. Commercially reasonable support will be provided to all other scenarios. When an adequate solution to your issue is not achieved, you might be referred to other support channels that are available for the non-Microsoft software.	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	26
How do I get support during an Outage or Service Interruption Event (SIE)?	Start by referring to [Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/service-health/), a personalized dashboard that provides guidance and support when issues in Azure services affect you. Unlike our public [status page](https://status.azure.com/) which provides general status information, Azure Service Health provides tailored information about the impact to your resources. To be notified of service issues, use Azure Service Health to [configure alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-activity-log-alerts-on-service-notifications?toc=/azure/service-health/toc.json) so that the right people are notified of service health events affecting your resources.

If you have one Azure Support plan and multiple EA enrollments, then support is only covered under the enrollment the support plan is tied to. Please note that if you have multiple Azure subscriptions under a single EA enrollment with a support plan, then all those subscriptions will have access to Technical Support.	https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/faq/		[]	false	[]	37
I've purchased support through my Enterprise Agreement (EA), but access to technical support is not enabled yet. How do I get technical support during this interim period?
